as follows:

     As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
     and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the document,
     this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to be covered
     by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however
     invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered by the
     GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may extend
     this exception to your version of the font, but you are not obligated
     to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
     from your version.
